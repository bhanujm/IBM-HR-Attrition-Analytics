## 🔍 Project Overview

Employee attrition is a major challenge for businesses, often costing \~30% of an employee’s annual salary in recruitment, training, and productivity losses.

This project analyzes IBM’s HR dataset (**1,470 employees, 35 attributes**) to uncover the **key drivers of employee attrition** and provide actionable strategies for retention.

The workflow follows a **real-world data analytics pipeline**: Data Cleaning → Feature Engineering → EDA → Predictive Modeling → Dashboarding → Business Recommendations.

## 🎯 Objectives

* Predict employee attrition using HR data.
* Identify demographic, job-related, and performance factors linked to turnover.
* Compare employees who **left** vs those who **stayed**.
* Build interactive dashboards to support HR decision-making.
* Recommend **practical strategies** to reduce attrition.

---

## ❓ Key Questions

* Do income levels and job roles affect attrition?
* How does overtime impact employee turnover?
* What is the relationship between tenure, promotions, and attrition?
* Which groups (by age, department, role) are most at risk?
* What interventions can reduce attrition costs?

## 💡 Key Insights

* Employees with **overtime** had an attrition rate of **31% vs 10%** without overtime.
* **Low-income employees (<\$3k)** had **34% attrition vs 9%** for high-income employees.
* **Sales Representatives** experienced the highest attrition (\~40%).
* Employees with **poor work-life balance** showed **31% attrition vs 12%** with excellent balance.
* **Younger employees (18–25)** had the highest churn (\~47%).
